Constructor: A constructor is a special function in Solidity that runs once when the contract is deployed, initializing the contractâ€™s state, such as setting the owner or initial values.

Modifier: A modifier is a reusable code block that can alter the behavior of functions, commonly used for access control or input validation, ensuring certain conditions are met before executing the function.
